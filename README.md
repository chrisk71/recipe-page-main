## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

With this challenge I learned how to style ordered and unordered lists and media queries for mobile screens.

### Continued development

I will continue to hone my skills using CSS grid/flexbox and get a better understanding of media queries.

### Useful resources

- [Recipe Page Project | edsHTML](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wF2DLQGeJS0) - I tried using a table for the nutritional info section but had difficulty. I checked out edsHTML tutorial and it was much easier to style using paragraphs for each text element in the HTML file.
